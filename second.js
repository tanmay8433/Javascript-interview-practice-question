// what is prototype chain
// every object contain the build in property is called prototype
// the prototype is itself an object
// so the prototype will have its own prototype
// the chain end when we reach a prototype that have null for its own prototype;
// and other word we can say
// prototype chaining is used for build new type of object based on the exist object and its like a inheritance in a class based language.
